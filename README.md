# Loan_Eligibility_Prediction_and_Application_Automation_ML
This project focuses on building a Loan Eligibility Prediction System and automating the loan application workflow using Machine Learning techniques. It aims to streamline the traditional loan approval process by reducing manual intervention, minimizing bias, and improving decision-making using data-driven insights.

# Project Overview

Traditional loan approval systems are often slow and inconsistent due to manual review. This project solves that by:

Predicting whether an applicant is eligible for a loan using ML.

Providing a centralized interface to manage loan applications.

Automating major steps in the loan workflow.

Improving accuracy and consistency with data-driven models.
